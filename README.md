## Features

This application has a list of restaurants from a given JSON file, which you can view on an interactive map (see Leaflet.js and Mapbox section below), and then click on the desired restaurant to view more detailed information including:

* Address
* Hours Open
* Reviews
* Location on interactive map

This application has been implemented to be easily viewable on a variety of formats including mobile, tablets, and desktop/laptop. It has also been programmed to be accessible friendly.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
